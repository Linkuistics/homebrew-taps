  # The VSCode companion extension (ADR-0028) is installed into another
  # application's directory, and only ever on the user's confirmed request. A
  # plain `brew uninstall` leaves it, on the same terms as ~/.config/modaliser;
  # `--zap` takes it away. This one path cannot run the install-time manifest
  # check — a zap list is a path list, not a program — so it claims LESS than
  # the install sweep does: it reserves the whole antony.modaliser-companion-*
  # prefix, which is inside the maintainer's own publisher namespace, rather
  # than this extension alone. Do not "tidy" it to the stronger claim.
  #
  # The glob is load-bearing, so it was read rather than remembered: zap's
  # trash: paths go through each_resolved_path, which expands a leading ~ and
  # then calls Pathname.glob on the result — Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/cask/
  # artifact/abstract_uninstall.rb, verified against the installed Homebrew.
