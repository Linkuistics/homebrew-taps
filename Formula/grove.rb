  def install
    # The methodology skill is NOT fetched or installed here. The `grove` binary
    # embeds the full `content/` tree (self-extension-core-and-methodology / task-tree-scheme) and provisions it to
    # ~/.claude/skills/grove/ on the first run, so the skill can never drift
    # from the binary. Do NOT reintroduce a content/ download into this formula
    # or the release tarball — `brew install grove` is the sole gesture.
    bin.install "grove", "grove-llm"
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      grove ships its methodology inside the binary. The first
        grove
      run from inside your working tree provisions the global skill at
      ~/.claude/skills/grove/ — there is no separate install step. The skill
      re-provisions automatically the next time you run `grove` after upgrading
      the formula.

      grove reads all of its launch policy from ~/.config/grove/config.kdl,
      which it never creates: give every session kind one command template
      before the first run.
